# Deep-learning  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/motkeg/Deep-learning.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/motkeg/Deep-learning)
Deep learning project to practice Neurons network made with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* **nn exapmles** - are some code snippet for verity of nn like CNN , RNN and using the TFlearn library
* **CreditCard fraud** - is the project that detact fraud in credit card tranactions on web.  
   _**note:**_ the data file 'creditcard.csv' are misssing because his size you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/data)

* **keras** - a usefull example of high level models using keras , upload them to GCP ml-engine and make live predictions.
